# Machine_Learning_Project23

We will be building a machine learning model that recommends songs to a user based on previous listening on Spotify.
We will clean the data to develop initial insights and estimations on possible recommendations. This will include Pandas and Matplotlib.
Then we will build the machine learning model. We'll likely play with 2-3 different types of models to see what works the best.
Likely, we'll do an initial model using clustering that recommends based on what songs are in the cluster.
Then we'll do a supervised version that recommends songs based on genre.
We'll test our models to see where different but similar genres are clustered together and play with conditions like restricting genre.
If we have time, we'll put our data into Tableau and develop some visualizations that can best illustrate what we found. This is an extra step since we'll already have some visualizations using Matplotlib.
